However, this tug-of-war that lasted for several years also provided a verification of the strategies and tactics of large-scale military operations after World War II. Nearly 80 years have passed since World War II. Although the 40-year Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union has promoted the development of science and technology and war theory, there is not enough practical basis to verify these advances.\n\nThe most recent full-scale war between the two military powers in the world should be the Gulf War in 1991. Iraq, known as the world's sixth military power, was defeated by the United States in just half a year. This is tantamount to the advanced integrated sea, land and air strategy and tactics of the United States at that time, achieving strategic goals through precise decapitation and destruction of enemy key cities and facilities.\n\nIn the 30 years after the Gulf War, the world's military powers are currently carrying out another military informationization reform, and this Ukrainian-Russian war can be a good verification of today's military theory. This project will focus on whether Ukraine and Russia's tactics are still centered around large cities.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nWe will first have a roughly understanding about the distribution of large cities and conflict locations in Ukraine.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(sf) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(mapview) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(ggplot2) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(leaflet) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(units) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(rnaturalearth) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load global country boundaries\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nukraine_boundary <- world %>% filter(name == \"Ukraine\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncities <- read.csv(\"worldcities.csv\")\nconflicts <- read.csv(\"event_1pd_latest_2024.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# filter ukraine data\nukraine_cities <- cities %>% filter(country == \"Ukraine\") %>%\n  select(city, lat, lng)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter the conflict data to remove outliers\nconflicts <- conflicts %>%\n  filter(latitude >= 44 & latitude <= 52, \n         longitude >= 22 & longitude <= 40) %>%\n  select(lat = latitude, lng = longitude) %>%\n  distinct(lat, lng, .keep_all = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert to spatial data frames\nukraine_cities_sf <- st_as_sf(ukraine_cities, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\nconflicts_sf <- st_as_sf(conflicts, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Draw the map of Ukraine and plot city points\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ukraine_boundary) +\n  geom_sf(data = ukraine_cities_sf, color = \"blue\", size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_sf(data = conflicts_sf, color = \"red\", size = 1.5, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(title = \"Map of Ukraine with Cities\",\n       x = \"Longitude\", y = \"Latitude\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see that most of the confliction is concentrated in the east of Ukraine, which is main target of Russia force in this war.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate distances between conflict events and cities\ndistances <- st_distance(ukraine_cities_sf, conflicts_sf)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the average distance for each city to all conflict points (in meters)\navg_distances <- apply(distances, 1, mean)\n\n# Convert distances to kilometers\navg_distances_km <- avg_distances / 1000\n\n# Add average distances to the city data for reference\nukraine_cities$avg_distance_to_conflicts_km <- avg_distances_km\n\n# Display the overall average\naverage_distance_km <- mean(avg_distances_km)\ncat(\"Average Conflict Distance to Cities (in km):\", average_distance_km)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAverage Conflict Distance to Cities (in km): 466.9814\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = as.data.frame(ukraine_cities)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = avg_distance_to_conflicts_km), bins = 30, fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of CIties Distance to Conflictions\",\n       x = \"Minimum Distance (KM)\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Hypothesis Testing (Regression)\n\nNull Hypothesis(H0): Conflict events are closer to major urban cities.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis(H1): Conflict events are not closer to major urban cities.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform to a projected CRS (e.g., UTM Zone 37N) for accurate distance calculations\nukraine_cities_projected <- st_transform(ukraine_cities_sf, crs = 32637)\nconflicts_projected <- st_transform(conflicts_sf, crs = 32637)\n\n# Define the buffer radius\nbuffer_radius <- 50000  #

This means that conflictions is always around cities, which means that Ukraine and Russian forces are still targeting on cities in this war.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe results of this project provide compelling evidence that the Ukrainian-Russian war has overwhelmingly centered around urban areas. Nearly all conflict events occurred within 50 kilometers of cities, highlighting the strategic importance of urban centers in modern warfare. This pattern aligns with historical observations of military tactics, where cities often serve as key targets due to their economic, logistical, and symbolic value.\n\nThe concentration of conflict near cities suggests that both Ukrainian and Russian forces have adopted strategies that prioritize control over urban areas. These findings underscore the enduring relevance of urban-centric military operations, even as warfare evolves in the era of advanced technologies and informationization. Despite advancements in military theory and tools over the past several decades, such as precision-guided strikes and decentralized operations, the fundamental significance of cities as pivotal nodes in large-scale conflicts remains unchanged.\n\nThis conclusion reinforces the notion that cities are not only strategic targets but also critical theaters for achieving broader military objectives. As seen in the Gulf War and reaffirmed in this conflict, the ability to control or disrupt urban centers can decisively influence the outcome of war. Moreover, the urban focus of modern warfare has profound implications for civilians, as it amplifies the human and economic toll of conflict in densely populated areas.\n\nThe Ukrainian-Russian war thus serves as a vital case study for understanding contemporary military tactics and validating post-Cold War military theories. While technological advancements have transformed how wars are fought, the geographic focus on urban centers underscores a continuity in military strategy that has persisted since World War II. Future analyses of this conflict should explore how emerging technologies, such as drones and cyberwarfare, are integrated into these urban-centric tactics and their potential to reshape the landscape of modern warfare.\n\n## Reference\nhttps://github.com/zhukovyuri/VIINA/?tab=readme-ov-file\n\nhttps://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities",
